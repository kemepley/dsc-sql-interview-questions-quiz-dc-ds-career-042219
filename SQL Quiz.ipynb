    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll go through a short quiz containing the types of questions about SQL and relational databases that you can expect to see in an interview. \n",

    "## SQL Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "what are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Text\n",
    "Integer\n",
    "Real\n",
    "Blob\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key is a column containing the unique ids for the table. A foreign key is a key from another table that matches with keys in a table you want to join\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________Inner - All of the rows in table A and table B which have the same specified key are joined.\n",
    "Left - All of the rows from the table on the left are retained. Additional information from the table on the right is added to the table when the specified key matches.\n",
    "Right - Same as left, but switch the left and the right roles.\n",
    "Outer - Only rows that do not share keys are used in the table\n",
    "Union - Adds all of the information from tables A and B together, matching on keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Group By clauses group items with the same column value. Agg functions allow us to aggregate a column, and we may want to aggregate by groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________\n",
    "In many to many joins, we match based on an id that is not unique. For example, if we have match an offices table to a restaurants table on a city column, there are more than one of restaurants and offices per city, so we get every combination offices and restaurants for a city.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
